# Regression-Modeling-Bike-Sharing-Demand

## Introduction

The **bike-sharing industry** has seen significant growth, with a global market value of $2.8 billion in 2023. This growth is attributed to factors such as convenience, sustainability, and the promotion of physical fitness. In response to this market expansion, the Cook County Planning and Development Department, responsible for the Chicago metropolitan area, has tasked us with developing a machine learning model to predict the number of bike rentals on a given day. Additionally, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing bike rental demand.

## Overview

**Best Performing Model**: 
The Decision Tree Regressor stands out as the best model among those we tested because it has the lowest RMSE (349.619399), meaning its predictions are usually closer to the real data. It also has the highest R-Squared value (0.68), indicating it can explain about 68% of the changes in our target variable better than the others.Additionally, when applied to the Kaggle dataset for prediction, the model achieved an accuracy of 80%, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

**Optimal Features**: Feature selection was performed using feature importance ranking, focusing on the most critical variables that impact bike rental demand.

**Target Variable**:  The model predicts the number of bike rentals, which is a continuous variable.

**Kaggle Dataset Performance**: Using the trained model on a Kaggle dataset for prediction resulted in an accuracy of 80%.

## Case - Cook County Planning and Development Department

**Audience**:City planners and development officers at the Cook County Planning and Development Department.

**Goal**: To predict daily bike rental demand and provide actionable insights to optimize bike-sharing operations and infrastructure planning.
 
**Target Users**:Residents and visitors of the Chicago metropolitan area who utilize bike-sharing services.
 
**Data**: Includes historical bike rental data, weather conditions, seasonal information, and socioeconomic indicators.
